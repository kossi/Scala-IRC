# Scala IRC

Upgraded to use the Akka 2.3 and the new Akka IO functionality. Some terrible changes but tried not to brake everything.

The original version and a readme are here: [Scala-IRC](https://github.com/aconbere/Scala-IRC).

Scala irc is a small irc framework focused on a simple interface for receiving and responding to messages and composable interfaces.
